## Article Structure

### **Section 1: Opening - The Simulation Trust Problem** (~350 words)

**Purpose:** Hook the reader and establish why this matters

**Key Elements:**
1. **Vision statement hook:** "Imagine testing routing policies, autoscaling strategies, and hardware configs without touching production. That's the promise of simulation—but only if it's accurate enough to trust."

2. **The gap:** "A simple queueing model predicts 50ms TTFT. Production measures 200ms. The difference reveals how much complexity hides beneath the surface."

3. **The stakes:** Why this matters
   - Capacity decisions are million-dollar bets (H100 vs A100, TP=4 vs TP=8)
   - Policy experiments on live traffic are risky
   - Intuition fails at scale

4. **The thesis:** Building a trustworthy simulator isn't about modeling *everything* - it's about modeling the *right physics*

5. **The BLIS approach (brief):** "BLIS achieves this through physics-informed modeling that runs entirely on CPU - no GPUs required. By combining analytical roofline models (compute vs memory bottlenecks) with learned corrections trained on real vLLM traces, it predicts GPU behavior in microseconds while maintaining single-digit percent accuracy."

6. **Reader promise:** "This article shows what it takes to build an inference simulator that captures the structural integrity of real systems - from token generation physics to distributed orchestration."

**Transition to Section 2:** "This article shows what it takes to build that level of fidelity—from token generation physics to distributed orchestration. Let's follow a request's 50-millisecond journey through the system to see where every millisecond of that complexity lives."

---

### **Section 2: A Request's Journey - The Hidden Complexity** (~1500 words)

**Purpose:** Show the three architectural layers and how they work together

**Opening Hook:** "A user hits enter. 50 milliseconds later, the first token appears. What happened? Three architectural layers working together: the inference engine (vLLM), the data plane (cluster orchestration), and the control plane (autoscaling). Model them all with fidelity, or your capacity decisions will be wrong."

---

#### **Layer 1: The Engine (vLLM)** (~500 words)

**Purpose:** Establish the batch-step paradigm and vLLM components

**Key Elements:**

1. **The critical insight: Steps, not requests**
   - vLLM processes batches in steps (not individual requests)
   - One GPU pass processes ALL requests in batch
   - Step time = slowest operation (prefill or decode)
   - Everyone in batch waits
   - Simple example: 4 requests, 1 processing 512-token prompt dominates step time

2. **Why per-request models fail**
   - Can't assume independence: requests coupled through batching
   - Throughput predictions 5-10x wrong if you miss this

3. **vLLM components BLIS replicates:**
   - Scheduling: Priority queues (critical > standard > batch)
   - KV Cache: Block allocation, prefix caching, eviction/preemption
   - Continuous Batching: Requests join/leave mid-flight

4. **Step Physics: How BLIS computes without GPUs** (weave in the CPU-only approach here)
   - For each step, compute two bottlenecks:
     - Compute time: FLOPs / GPU_TFLOPS (e.g., ~20ms for 512-token prefill on H100)
     - Memory time: Bytes / GPU_Bandwidth (e.g., ~2ms for decode reading KV cache)
   - Step time = max(compute, memory) - the slower operation
   - Apply learned corrections (β coefficients trained on 137K real vLLM requests)
   - **This is why BLIS is CPU-only but accurate:** We compute the same bottleneck analysis vLLM's GPU experiences, using model architecture (from HuggingFace config) + hardware specs (from datasheets). No GPU execution needed.

5. **Batch evolution example (brief):**
   - Small batch → fast (2ms/token)
   - Long prompt joins → everyone waits (20ms)
   - Prompt finishes → back to fast
   - Requests complete at different times → batch size changing

6. **The takeaway:** Can't model with per-request equations. vLLM works in batches/steps. BLIS captures this through discrete-event simulation - one step event per batch operation.

**llm-d parity notes:** vLLM is the primary engine in llm-d. BLIS replicates vLLM semantics exactly (scheduling, KV cache, batching).

#### **Layer 2: The Data Plane (Cluster Orchestration)** (~500 words)

**Purpose:** Show cluster-level coordination: admission, routing, P/D orchestration

**Key Elements:**

1. **What it is:** Cluster coordination across multiple vLLM instances (llm-d's Inference Scheduler, Disaggregated Serving Sidecar)

2. **Gate 1: Admission Control**
   - Token bucket rate limiting
   - Prevents queue explosion
   - llm-d parity

3. **Gate 2: Flow Control (Gateway Queue)**
   - Holds requests until cluster has capacity
   - Late binding: routes with fresh state
   - **BLIS innovation:** Not in llm-d yet, 20-40% TTFT improvement under load spikes

4. **Gate 3: Routing - Signal Staleness is Critical**
   - **Signal freshness tiers:**
     - Router-local (InFlightRequests): always fresh
     - Instance-reported (QueueDepth, KVUtil): periodic (~10ms stale)
     - Cache state: ~2s blind spot (llm-d ZMQ propagation delay)
   - **Why it matters:** 10 routing decisions see same stale KVUtil → pile-on
   - **Weighted scoring:** `precise-prefix-cache:2, queue-depth:1, kv-utilization:1`
   - **llm-d parity:** Default profile, signal freshness, 2s cache delay match production
   - **BLIS superset:** Additional scorers (precise-prefix-cache queries actual KV state, no-hit-lru)

5. **Gate 4: P/D Orchestration (if disaggregated)**
   - Prefill and decode on separate pools
   - KV transfer over network (15-30ms for long contexts)
   - TTFT = prefill + transfer + first_decode
   - llm-d's Disaggregated Serving Sidecar
   - BLIS models coordinated routing + transfer costs

6. **Why data plane matters:** Under load, stale signals cause pile-on. BLIS models the staleness because that's the production reality.

**llm-d parity emphasis:** Weave in naturally - "matches production Inference Scheduler", "llm-d's ZMQ delay", etc.

---

#### **Layer 3: The Control Plane (Autoscaling)** (~250 words)

**Purpose:** Show autoscaling with feedback delays

**Key Elements:**

1. **What it is:** Adjusts instance count while requests flow (llm-d's Variant Autoscaler)

2. **The autoscaling loop:**
   - Collect metrics from vLLM (Prometheus every 10s)
   - Analyze capacity vs demand
   - Decide: scale up/down?
   - Actuate: add/remove instances

3. **But delay compounds:**
   - Provisioning: ~45s (Kubernetes + model download)
   - Warmup: ~10s (vLLM initialization)
   - Total: ~55s from decision to ready

4. **BLIS WVA pipeline:**
   - Workload (Collector): per-replica metrics
   - Variant (Analyzer): capacity vs demand per GPU type + TP
   - Actuator: optimize scale decisions
   - Node lifecycle: Ready → Loading (45s) → WarmingUp (10s) → Active

5. **Why it matters:** Without modeling delays, can't predict oscillation. Scale aggressively → 55s wait → load spikes again → queue explodes → overcapacity when all come online.

6. **llm-d alignment:** Variant Autoscaler in production. BLIS enables policy experimentation.

#### **The Complete Journey** (~300 words)

**Purpose:** Show all three layers working together for one request

**Key Elements:**

1. **Trace one request end-to-end with timestamps:**
   - Data plane: Arrival → admission → gateway queue (2ms) → routing with stale signals → dispatch (1ms)
   - Engine level: Wait queue (5ms) → KV allocation (38 blocks cached!) → prefill (20ms) → decode (10 tokens × 2ms)
   - Control plane: (in parallel) Autoscaler tick → observes load → triggers scale-up (55s to ready)

2. **TTFT breakdown:** Gateway 3ms, queue 5ms, prefill 20ms, decode 2ms, overhead 18ms → **48ms total**

3. **Where every millisecond came from:**
   - Stale signals: +1ms (suboptimal routing)
   - Prefix caching: -15ms saved (38 blocks reused)
   - Gateway queue: +2ms but prevented 50ms pile-on

4. **The insight:** Every millisecond has a cause. Can't see trade-offs without simulating the journey.

**Executive takeaway box:** "High-fidelity means modeling all three layers: engine level (vLLM's scheduling, KV cache, batch-step execution), data plane (admission, routing with stale signals, P/D orchestration), and control plane (autoscaling with delays). BLIS models every layer - that's why predictions match reality."

### **Section 3: BLIS in Action - A Real Scenario** (~400 words)

**Purpose:** Show concrete use case with validation numbers

**Key Elements:**

1. **Setup the decision:** Pick a scenario where we have actual validation data - routing policy comparison, capacity planning, or another architectural decision we can back with sim-vs-real numbers.

2. **The experiment in BLIS:**
   - Show the commands used
   - Make it reproducible
   - Keep it simple enough to understand

3. **Results comparison:**
   - Real production numbers vs BLIS predictions
   - Show accuracy metrics (MAPE, error %)
   - Table or chart format

4. **The insight:** Show what the simulator enabled - a decision that would have been expensive/risky to test in production, now validated cheaply and safely.

5. **What this enables:**
   - Architecture decisions (hardware, TP configs)
   - Policy optimization (test 10 routing configs in minutes)
   - Capacity planning (how many instances for X req/s?)
   - Research sandbox (validate novel mechanisms before production)

6. **The confidence statement:** "When your simulator models engine physics, data plane coordination, and control plane delays, you can make architectural decisions based on simulation. That's the unlock."

**NOTE:** Must use an example where we have validation data. Do NOT use PD disaggregation unless we collect real comparison numbers first.

### **Section 4: Closing - From Modeling to Validation** (~400 words)

**Purpose:** Recap journey, tease next article (validation), soft CTA

**Key Elements:**

1. **Recap the journey:**
   - Covered how BLIS achieves speed + accuracy (CPU-only with physics + learning)
   - Followed request through three layers (engine, data plane, control plane)
   - Saw real scenario (PD disaggregation trade-off)

2. **The modeling achievement:**
   - Engine layer: vLLM parity (batch-step execution, KV cache, scheduling)
   - Data plane: llm-d parity (routing, signal staleness, admission) + innovations (gateway queue, additional scorers)
   - Control plane: llm-d Variant Autoscaler with realistic delays

3. **The parity + innovation story:**
   - "BLIS matches production where it exists (llm-d Inference Scheduler, vLLM engine)"
   - "And pioneers mechanisms that could be contributed back (gateway queue, autoscaling experiments)"
   - "The simulator becomes a forcing function for community innovation"

4. **The missing piece - tease next article:**
   - "But here's the critical question: how do we *know* this modeling is accurate?"
   - "That's where validation comes in - and it's complex enough to deserve its own article."
   - "How do you prove a simulator works? Can't just eyeball metrics. Production traces are noisy. Invariants matter as much as numbers."
   - "BLIS has an answer: observe/replay/calibrate pipeline, golden datasets, 11 structural invariants checked on every run."
   - "**Next article: Validating Against Ground Truth** - how BLIS achieves single-digit percent error on real workloads, catches regressions before they ship, and why validation is a discipline, not a step."

5. **Call to action (soft):**
   - "For now, the takeaway: high-fidelity simulation starts with modeling the right physics."
   - "Engine mechanisms + data plane coordination + control plane delays. All three layers, working together."
   - "Get the modeling right, and validation becomes possible. Get it wrong, and no amount of testing will save you."

6. **Final beat:** "BLIS shows it's possible to simulate inference serving with production-grade accuracy - no GPUs required. That's what it takes to build trust."

## Writing Guidelines for Contributors

### Tone & Style

- **Accessible:** Write for executives AND engineers. No jargon without explanation.
- **Conversational:** "Here's what most people miss..." not "It is observed that..."
- **Concrete:** Use examples over abstractions. Show, don't just tell.
- **Punchy:** Short sentences. One idea per sentence. Break up long paragraphs.
- **Storytelling:** This is a journey. Use transitions. Build narrative momentum.

### What to Include

- **llm-d parity:** Weave in naturally (don't save for end). "matches llm-d's...", "production Inference Scheduler uses...", etc.
- **BLIS innovations:** Call out where BLIS goes beyond (gateway queue, additional scorers, autoscaling experiments)
- **Concrete numbers:** Real latencies (20ms, 2ms, 55s), not just "faster"
- **Why it matters:** Every technical point needs "why this matters for predictions"

### What to Avoid

- **Deep technical jargon:** No "heterogeneous batch composition tensor operations"
- **Formulas:** No equations in main text (save for docs)
- **Implementation details:** No file names, function names, code structure
- **Passive voice:** "BLIS models..." not "Is modeled by..."
- **Hedging:** "BLIS achieves X" not "BLIS appears to achieve X"

### Transitions Between Sections

Each section should end with a sentence that sets up the next section:
- Section 1 → 2: "Let's follow a request's 50-millisecond journey through the system to see where that complexity lives."
- Section 2 → 3: "Let's see this in action with a real decision."
- Section 3 → 4: "This is just the modeling story. Next comes validation."

### Key Messages to Hit

1. **CPU-only is an enabler:** Fast + accurate without GPUs (physics + learning)
2. **Batch-step paradigm:** vLLM processes batches in steps, not individual requests
3. **Signal staleness matters:** Data plane routing depends on stale signals
4. **All layers required:** Engine + data plane + control plane for fidelity
5. **llm-d parity + innovation:** Match production, pioneer new mechanisms
6. **Quantify trade-offs:** BLIS lets you evaluate architectures before deploying

### Executive Takeaway Boxes

Include 1-sentence executive takeaway boxes at key points:
- End of Layer 1 (The Engine)
- End of The Complete Journey
- These should be bold, standalone, understandable without context

## Coordination Notes

- **Lead writer:** Should own Section 1 (opening), The Complete Journey, and Section 4 (closing) for narrative cohesion
- **Layer 1 (The Engine):** Needs vLLM expertise - batch-step paradigm is critical; also weave in CPU-only approach when discussing step physics
- **Layer 2 (The Data Plane):** Needs llm-d knowledge - routing, signal staleness, P/D orchestration
- **Layer 3 (The Control Plane):** Needs autoscaling/Kubernetes background
- **Example (Section 3):** Can run actual BLIS experiments to get real numbers

**Review checkpoints:**
1. Outline approval (this document)
2. Section drafts (independently)
3. Integration review (check transitions, tone consistency)
4. Final polish (lead writer unifies voice)
