# BLIS — Blackbox Inference Simulator

A discrete-event simulator for LLM inference serving systems. BLIS models multi-instance clusters with configurable admission control, request routing, KV-cache dynamics (including tiered GPU+CPU offloading), scheduling policies, and token generation — all driven by pluggable latency models (data-driven coefficients, analytical roofline, or custom backends).

The simulator is CPU-only, deterministic, and designed for **capacity planning**, **policy optimization research**, and **performance prediction** across model/GPU/TP configurations without requiring real GPUs.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim.git
cd inference-sim
go build -o blis main.go
./blis run --model qwen/qwen3-14b
```

## Key Features

- **Discrete-event simulation** for prefill, decode, and request scheduling
- **Deterministic execution** — same seed produces byte-identical output across runs
- **KV-cache modeling** with prefix caching and tiered GPU+CPU offload
- **Chunked prefill and preemption-aware batch formation**
- **Pluggable latency models** — roofline (default, analytical FLOPs/bandwidth) and trained-physics (physics-informed basis functions with MoE-aware scaling), with an extensible interface for custom backends
- **Multi-instance cluster simulation** with shared-clock event loop
- **Pluggable routing policies** — round-robin, least-loaded, and composable weighted-scoring with six pluggable scorers (default: precise-prefix-cache, queue-depth, kv-utilization)
- **Admission control**, **priority policies**, and **instance schedulers** — each a pluggable policy axis
- **Canonical workload specification** — multi-client YAML DSL with Poisson/Gamma/Weibull/constant arrival processes, 5 distribution types, SLO classes (critical/standard/sheddable/batch/background), prefix groups, cohort dynamics, multimodal, reasoning multi-turn, and composable specs via `blis compose`
- **Rich metrics pipeline** — per-request, per-instance, and cluster-level metrics including TTFT/ITL/E2E distributions, KV cache diagnostics, anomaly detection (priority inversions, HOL blocking), SLO attainment, Jain fairness index, and multi-objective fitness evaluation
- **Decision tracing and counterfactual analysis** with top-k regret computation
- **Hypothesis experimentation framework** for rigorous, reproducible experiments

## Architecture Overview

```
Request Arrival → Admission → Routing → WaitQueue → Batch Formation → Step Execution → Completion
                                            ↓              ↓
                                      KV Allocation   Latency Estimation
```

Admission and Routing apply in cluster mode (multi-instance). Single-instance mode skips directly to WaitQueue.
