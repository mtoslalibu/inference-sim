# Feature Specification: Phase 1C Model Autoscaler

**Feature Branch**: `006-model-autoscaler`  
**Created**: 2026-04-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Tracking Issue**: [#696](https://github.com/inference-sim/inference-sim/issues/696)  
**Design Document**: `docs/plans/2026-04-01-phase1c-autoscaling-design.md`

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Pipeline Contracts and Wiring (Priority: P1)

A researcher configuring a BLIS simulation wants to enable dynamic replica management so that the simulator can scale model instances up or down during a run in response to load. Without this, all experiments use fixed replica counts and cannot model autoscaling behavior at all.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational step. All other stories depend on the four interfaces (Collector, Analyzer, Engine, Actuator) and their wiring into the simulation event loop. Without the contracts defined and the tick event firing the pipeline, nothing else can be built or tested.

**Independent Test**: Enable autoscaling with a zero-interval tick and a no-op pipeline (all interfaces return empty/zero results). The simulation output must be byte-identical to a run without autoscaling enabled, confirming the pipeline is wired but not disruptive.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a simulation with `ModelAutoscalerIntervalUs = 0`, **When** the simulation runs, **Then** no scaling tick is ever scheduled and no autoscaler logic executes.
2. **Given** a simulation with `ModelAutoscalerIntervalUs = T`, **When** the simulation runs past time T, **Then** a scaling tick fires at `t=0`, `t=T`, `t=2T`.
3. **Given** a no-op pipeline where all interfaces return empty/zero results, **When** the simulation runs, **Then** the output is byte-identical to a run without the autoscaler (determinism preserved).
4. **Given** `HPAScrapeDelay = constant(0)`, **When** a tick fires, **Then** the actuation event fires in the same simulation tick.
5. **Given** `HPAScrapeDelay = constant(30s)`, **When** a tick fires at time T, **Then** the actuation event fires at time T+30s.

### User Story 2 - V2 Saturation-Based Scale Signal (Priority: P2)

A researcher running a load spike experiment wants the simulator to detect when replicas are near saturation and emit a scale-up signal, and to detect when replicas have excess headroom and emit a scale-down signal — matching how the llm-d WVA V2 saturation analyzer works in production.

**Why this priority**: The V2SaturationAnalyzer is the reference algorithm from WVA that the llm-d team can recognize and validate. Without it, there is no meaningful capacity signal to drive scaling decisions. It is the analytical core of the model autoscaler baseline.

**WVA V2 approach**: Capacity is measured in **token units**, not percentages. Each replica has two capacity bounds:
- **k1 (memory-bound)**: `TotalKvCapacityTokens * KvCacheThreshold` — how many tokens the GPU memory can hold
- **k2 (compute-bound)**: derived from observed saturated throughput, historical rolling average, analytical estimate, or k1 fallback (priority chain)
- **Effective capacity** = `min(k1, k2)` — the tighter constraint wins
- **Demand per replica** = `tokensInUse + (queueLength * avgInputTokens)`

Model-level signals:
- `RequiredCapacity = max(0, (totalDemand / ScaleUpThreshold) - totalAnticipatedSupply)`
- `SpareCapacity = max(0, totalSupply - (totalDemand / ScaleDownBoundary))`

**Independent Test**: Inject a ModelSignals snapshot with all replicas where demand exceeds effective capacity and verify RequiredCapacity > 0. Inject a snapshot where supply greatly exceeds demand (accounting for ScaleDownBoundary) and verify SpareCapacity > 0.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** replicas where total demand (in tokens) exceeds `totalSupply * ScaleUpThreshold`, **When** Analyze is called, **Then** RequiredCapacity is positive and SpareCapacity is zero.
2. **Given** replicas where `totalSupply > totalDemand / ScaleDownBoundary` and removing one replica still leaves adequate supply, **When** Analyze is called, **Then** SpareCapacity is positive.
3. **Given** a single replica, **When** Analyze is called with that replica near saturation, **Then** SpareCapacity is zero (cannot scale below one replica).
4. **Given** a model with no active replicas, **When** Analyze is called, **Then** all output fields are zero and no division-by-zero occurs.
5. **Given** mixed variants serving the same model, **When** Analyze is called, **Then** the sum of per-variant supply values equals TotalSupply and the sum of per-variant demand values equals TotalDemand.
6. **Given** a replica where k1 (memory-bound) < k2 (compute-bound), **When** per-replica capacity is computed, **Then** effective capacity equals k1 (memory is the bottleneck).

### User Story 3 - End-to-End WVA Loop: Collector, Actuator, and UnlimitedEngine (Priority: P2)

A researcher running a scaling experiment wants the simulator to actually add or remove replicas when the autoscaler emits scale decisions, so that future requests are routed to the adjusted replica set. This story delivers the complete end-to-end WVA loop: `DefaultCollector → V2SaturationAnalyzer → UnlimitedEngine → DirectActuator`.

**Why this priority**: Without the Collector (to read cluster state), the Engine (to convert signals to decisions), and the Actuator (to apply decisions), the pipeline produces signals that go nowhere. These components close the loop and make the autoscaler functional end-to-end. UnlimitedEngine (which ignores GPU inventory constraints) is included here because it is the simplest engine that completes the loop for fixed-node testing.

**Independent Test**: Run the minimal viable pipeline (DefaultCollector → V2SaturationAnalyzer → UnlimitedEngine → DirectActuator) against a simulated cluster under load. Verify that a scale-up decision results in a new instance being placed, and a scale-down decision results in an existing instance entering drain state.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a RouterState with active model instances, **When** DefaultCollector.Collect is called, **Then** one ModelSignals entry is produced per active model, with one ReplicaMetrics entry per active instance.
2. **Given** a ScaleDecision with Delta > 0, **When** DirectActuator.Apply is called, **Then** PlacementEngine attempts to place a new instance for the specified model and variant.
3. **Given** a ScaleDecision with Delta < 0, **When** DirectActuator.Apply is called, **Then** the selected instance enters Draining state, stops receiving new requests, and its GPUs are freed only after all in-flight requests complete.
4. **Given** a scale-down decision for a model that also has a pending scale-up placement, **When** DirectActuator.Apply is called, **Then** the pending placement is cancelled before drain begins.
5. **Given** an AnalyzerResult with RequiredCapacity > 0 and sufficient capacity, **When** UnlimitedEngine.Optimize is called, **Then** it selects the cheapest variant without checking GPU inventory.
6. **Given** the full pipeline wired end-to-end under synthetic high load, **When** two scaling ticks fire, **Then** at least one PlaceInstance call occurs (scale-up propagated through the entire pipeline).

### User Story 4 - GreedyEngine: Inventory-Aware Variant Allocation (Priority: P3)

A researcher running a multi-variant experiment (e.g., A100 and H100 nodes in the same pool) wants the autoscaler to make cost-aware allocation decisions that respect GPU inventory: preferring the cheapest available variant for scale-up and targeting the most expensive active variant for scale-down.

**Why this priority**: GreedyEngine adds GPU inventory awareness on top of UnlimitedEngine (delivered in US3). It handles multi-model scenarios where GPU capacity may be scarce across multiple simultaneously-scaling models. This is also the primary Phase 2 research hook for OpenEvolve/AlphaEvolve.

**Independent Test**: Configure a cluster with two variants (cheap/expensive) and trigger scale-up. Verify GreedyEngine selects the cheaper variant. Remove all capacity from the cheaper variant and verify it falls back to the more expensive one.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** two variants with different costs and both have available GPU slots, **When** GreedyEngine processes a scale-up signal, **Then** it selects the variant with the lower cost per replica.
2. **Given** the cheapest variant has no available GPU slots, **When** GreedyEngine processes a scale-up signal, **Then** it falls back to the next cheapest variant that has available slots.
3. **Given** a scale-down signal for a model with replicas across two variants, **When** GreedyEngine processes the signal, **Then** it targets the most expensive active variant.
4. **Given** GPU inventory is insufficient to satisfy scale-up requests for multiple models simultaneously, **When** GreedyEngine processes all results, **Then** models with higher RequiredCapacity are served before models with lower RequiredCapacity.

### User Story 5 - Stabilization Window / Flap Prevention (Priority: P3) ✅ Implemented in 1C-1a

A researcher studying oscillation behavior wants to configure HPA-aligned stabilization windows so that the autoscaler only acts once a scaling signal has been consistently present — preventing premature action on transient load spikes, matching the stabilization window behavior in Kubernetes HPA.

**Why this priority**: Without a stabilization window, the pipeline acts on the first tick a signal appears, which can cause oscillation under bursty load. The stabilization window is the primary mechanism for preventing flapping.

**Independent Test**: Configure ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs = 60s with a 30s tick interval. Signal present at ticks T=0, T=30s, T=60s. Verify: no ScaleDecision forwarded at T=0 or T=30s (window not elapsed); ScaleDecision forwarded at T=60s (elapsed == window).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** scale-up signal first appears for model M at time T with ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs = 60s, **When** the next tick fires at T + 30s and signal is still present, **Then** the decision is suppressed (elapsed 30s < 60s window).
2. **Given** scale-up signal first appeared for model M at time T with ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs = 60s, **When** the tick fires at T + 60s and signal is still present, **Then** a scale-up ScaleDecision is forwarded (elapsed == window).
3. **Given** scale-up signal first appears at T, disappears at T+30s, and reappears at T+60s with ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs = 60s, **Then** the timer resets at T+30s; the decision is not forwarded until T+120s.
4. **Given** ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs = 0, **When** consecutive ticks produce scale-up signals, **Then** all decisions are forwarded without suppression.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a model has zero active replicas? Collector produces empty Replicas list; Analyzer returns all-zero result; no scale-down is emitted.
- What happens when GPU inventory is fully exhausted? GreedyEngine emits no scale-up decisions for affected models; UnlimitedEngine ignores inventory and still emits decisions. No panic or silent failure.
- What happens when both RequiredCapacity and SpareCapacity are non-zero for the same model? Neither should be non-zero simultaneously — Analyzer implementations must ensure scale-up and scale-down signals are mutually exclusive.
- What happens when HPAScrapeDelay is sampled as zero? The actuation event fires in the same tick as the scaling tick; causality is preserved.
- What happens when a Draining instance's model receives another scale-down decision? The Draining instance is already excluded from routing; the decision targets a different active instance.
- What happens when a placement fails because capacity is unavailable? A PendingPlacement is queued; no ScaleDecision is silently dropped.
- What happens when k2 (compute-bound) cannot be derived? V2SaturationAnalyzer falls back to k1 (memory-bound) as the effective capacity.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Pipeline Orchestration**

- **FR-001**: The simulator MUST fire the autoscaling pipeline at a configurable interval (`ModelAutoscalerIntervalUs`); when the interval is zero, no tick is ever scheduled.
- **FR-002**: The pipeline MUST execute in order: Collector → Analyzer (per model) → Engine → schedule actuation event after `HPAScrapeDelay` → Actuator applies decisions.
- **FR-003**: The pipeline MUST support per-model HPA-aligned stabilization windows (`ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs`, `ScaleDownStabilizationWindowUs`); a decision is forwarded only after the signal has been continuously present for the window duration; signal loss resets the timer; window=0 passes on first signal.
- **FR-004**: The actuation step MUST be separated from the decision step by a configurable delay (`HPAScrapeDelay`), which defaults to zero for determinism compatibility.

**Collector**

- **FR-005**: The Collector MUST produce exactly one ModelSignals snapshot per active model from the current cluster state, grouping all replicas for that model together.
- **FR-006**: The Collector MUST NOT filter, threshold, or modify the raw per-replica signals it collects.

**Analyzer**

- **FR-007**: Each Analyzer MUST produce model-level aggregate supply and demand from the per-replica snapshots it receives; it MUST NOT access cluster state directly.
- **FR-008**: Every Analyzer MUST handle the zero-replica case by returning all-zero output without error.
- **FR-009**: Every Analyzer result MUST satisfy: the sum of per-variant supply equals TotalSupply, and the sum of per-variant demand equals TotalDemand.
- **FR-010**: The V2SaturationAnalyzer MUST compute per-replica capacity as `min(k1_memory, k2_compute)` in token units, and demand as `tokensInUse + queueLength * avgInputTokens`. Scale-up when `(totalDemand / ScaleUpThreshold) > totalSupply`; scale-down when `totalSupply > (totalDemand / ScaleDownBoundary)` with N-1 redistribution safety check.
- **FR-011**: An Analyzer MUST NOT emit both a positive RequiredCapacity and a positive SpareCapacity for the same model in the same call.

**Engine**

- **FR-013**: The Engine MUST emit at most one ScaleDecision per model per call; it reassesses on the next tick.
- **FR-014**: The Engine MUST NOT emit both a scale-up and a scale-down decision for the same model in one call.
- **FR-015**: When scaling up, the Engine MUST select the variant with the lowest cost per replica that satisfies the capacity constraint.
- **FR-016**: When scaling down, the Engine MUST target the variant with the highest cost per replica that has active replicas.
- **FR-017**: The GreedyEngine MUST respect the GPU inventory: it may only target a variant for scale-up if free GPU slots are available for that variant's tensor-parallel degree.
- **FR-018**: When multiple models need scale-up and GPU inventory is insufficient for all, the Engine MUST prioritize models with higher RequiredCapacity.

**Actuator**

- **FR-019**: The Actuator MUST attempt placement for scale-up decisions and MUST NOT silently drop failures; failed placements produce a queued pending placement.
- **FR-020**: The Actuator MUST set a replica to Draining for scale-down decisions, ensuring it stops receiving new requests and its GPUs are freed only after all in-flight requests complete.
- **FR-021**: Before applying a scale-down decision, the Actuator MUST cancel any pending placements for the same model to prevent simultaneous scale-up and scale-down churn.
- **FR-022**: The Actuator MUST NOT block; all effects are scheduled as future simulation events.

### Key Entities

- **ModelSignals**: A snapshot of all replica states for one model at the moment of collection. Contains one ReplicaMetrics per active replica.
- **ReplicaMetrics**: The state of a single replica at collection time: KV utilization, queue depth, in-flight count, time-to-first-token, dispatch rate, and the hardware variant it runs on.
- **AnalyzerResult**: The model-level capacity assessment output by an Analyzer: aggregate supply, aggregate demand, scale-up signal (RequiredCapacity), scale-down signal (SpareCapacity), and a per-variant breakdown.
- **VariantCapacity**: One variant's share of the model's total supply and demand, with replica count and cost per replica. Used by the Engine to make allocation decisions.
- **ScaleDecision**: A single instruction to change replica count for one model+variant combination. Positive delta = add replicas, negative delta = remove replicas.
- **GPUInventory**: A read-only snapshot of free GPU slots per variant at the time the Engine is called, accounting for running and loading instances but not pending placements.
- **VariantSpec**: The hardware configuration identifier: GPU type and tensor-parallel degree. Used as the key in GPUInventory and as the target in ScaleDecision.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A simulation with the minimal viable pipeline (DefaultCollector → V2SaturationAnalyzer → UnlimitedEngine → DirectActuator) runs to completion without error on any workload configuration that runs today without the autoscaler.
- **SC-002**: With `HPAScrapeDelay = 0` and a no-op pipeline, simulation output is byte-identical to a run without the autoscaler enabled (zero regression on existing determinism).
- **SC-003**: The full pipeline (tick → collect → analyze × N models → optimize → actuate) completes within each scaling tick without delaying the simulation clock; autoscaler overhead does not appear in simulated time.
- **SC-004**: A controlled scale-up experiment — where load is driven above the saturation threshold — results in at least one new replica being placed within two scaling ticks of the threshold being exceeded.
- **SC-005**: A controlled scale-down experiment — where load drops and stays below the spare capacity threshold for the required hysteresis period — results in at least one replica entering drain state.
- **SC-006**: All autoscaler sub-issues (1C-1a, 1C-1b, 1C-1d) can be implemented and tested independently without requiring the others to be complete, confirming interface isolation.
- **SC-007**: The Analyzer and Engine interfaces are independently swappable: any Analyzer implementation works with any Engine implementation without modification to either.
- **SC-008**: Replacing the autoscaler configuration with a different Analyzer or Engine implementation requires changing only the configuration, not any simulation core code.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Four interfaces: Collector, Analyzer, Engine, Actuator
- All shared data types: ModelSignals, ReplicaMetrics, AnalyzerResult, VariantCapacity, ScaleDecision, GPUInventory, VariantSpec
- Pipeline event types: ScalingTickEvent, ScaleActuationEvent
- Pipeline orchestration wiring: tick handler, actuation event handler, stabilization window tracking
- Configuration fields: ModelAutoscalerIntervalUs, HPAScrapeDelay, ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs, ScaleDownStabilizationWindowUs
- Reference implementations: DefaultCollector, V2SaturationAnalyzer, GreedyEngine, UnlimitedEngine, DirectActuator
- Cross-cutting invariants: INV-A1 through INV-A7, INV-1 extension with drained_dropped terminal state
- Integration test: full pipeline end-to-end with a simulated cluster

### Out of Scope

- Cluster autoscaler (node provisioning): specs/008
- Coordinator and PendingPlacement queue: specs/009
- Full DrainPolicy interface (ImmediateDrain, WaitDrain, RedirectDrain): specs/010
- Observability and per-model autoscaler metrics: specs/011
- Scale-from-zero (no active replicas → first placement): deferred
- QueueingModelAnalyzer (M/M/1/K-SD with online parameter learning): #954
- Baseline analyzers (UtilizationAnalyzer, QueueAnalyzer): removed from scope
- MIP solver Engine: Phase 2 OpenEvolve target

## Assumptions

- GPU inventory is a committed-state snapshot: free slots = total − running − loading. Pending placements are not subtracted (no GPU committed yet). Draining instances are subtracted (they hold GPUs until drain completes).
- WaitDrain semantics are the default for DirectActuator scale-down: the instance stops receiving new requests immediately but GPU slots are freed only after all in-flight requests complete. Full DrainPolicy selection is deferred to specs/010.
- The Analyzer is stateless across ticks. State is held in the struct, not across interface boundaries.
- Stabilization window state (`scaleUpFirstSignalAt`, `scaleDownFirstSignalAt` maps keyed by ModelID) is tracked in the pipeline orchestrator (`autoscalerPipeline` in `autoscaler.go`), not inside any interface, so Engine and Analyzer remain stateless and independently testable.
- Each Analyzer is called once per model per tick. There is no batch call across models; the Engine is the cross-model layer.
- The minimal viable pipeline for WVA team validation is: DefaultCollector → V2SaturationAnalyzer → UnlimitedEngine → DirectActuator. GreedyEngine is additive (1C-1d). QueueingModelAnalyzer is a future addition (#954).
- HPAScrapeDelay defaults to zero. This preserves byte-identical output with existing tests (INV-6 determinism) and allows the delay to be introduced explicitly for oscillation research.
