# Research: Phase 1C Model Autoscaler

**Branch**: `006-model-autoscaler`  
**Phase**: 0 — Resolved decisions before implementation begins  
**Source**: Codebase exploration of `sim/cluster/`, `sim/router_state.go`, `sim/rng.go`

## Decision 1: PlacementManager.PlaceInstance vs "PlacementEngine.TryPlace"

**Decision**: `DirectActuator` calls `PlacementManager.PlaceInstance(id, model, gpuType, tpDegree)` directly.

**Rationale**: The design doc and issue text use the conceptual name "PlacementEngine.TryPlace()". The actual type in the codebase is `PlacementManager` (defined in `sim/cluster/infra_placement.go`) with method `PlaceInstance(id InstanceID, model, gpuType string, tpDegree int) (nodeID string, gpuIDs []string, err error)`. No interface extraction is needed for this scope. `DirectActuator` is a concrete struct in `sim/cluster/` and has direct access to `ClusterSimulator.pm` (the PlacementManager).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Extract a `Placer` interface: adds indirection with no immediate benefit. Deferred to a later PR if needed for testing isolation.
- Use `PlaceInstance` via a passed-in closure: unnecessary complexity for a concrete type.

## Decision 2: Variant info in RoutingSnapshot

**Decision**: Add `GPUType string`, `TPDegree int`, and `CostPerHour float64` to `RoutingSnapshot` (in `sim/router_state.go`). Populate in `buildRouterState()` from the instance's configuration.

**Rationale**: `DefaultCollector.Collect(*RouterState) []ModelSignals` receives only `RouterState`. The current `RoutingSnapshot` has no variant information (`GPUType`, `TPDegree`). To enable `DefaultCollector` to populate `ReplicaMetrics.Variant` and `ReplicaMetrics.CostPerHour` without broadening its interface, the variant fields must be present in `RoutingSnapshot`. This is a clean additive change: `sim/router_state.go` is in the `sim/` package which does not import `sim/cluster/`, so there is no import cycle. `buildRouterState()` in `cluster_event.go` already has access to instance config and can populate these fields.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Change `Collect` signature to `Collect(*RouterState, variantLookup func(id string) VariantSpec)`: breaks the declared interface contract and adds complexity to all Collector implementations.
- Access `ClusterSimulator.instances` directly from `DefaultCollector`: requires `DefaultCollector` to hold a `*ClusterSimulator` reference. This is fine for `DirectActuator` (which already needs the cluster reference) but unnecessarily couples `DefaultCollector` to the simulator for something that belongs in the snapshot.

---

## Decision 3: CostPerReplica propagation chain

**Decision**: Add `CostPerHour float64` to `NodePoolConfig` (in `infra_config.go`). Populate `RoutingSnapshot.CostPerHour` from the instance's node pool. `DefaultCollector` maps `RoutingSnapshot.CostPerHour` to a `CostPerHour float64` field added to `ReplicaMetrics`. `Analyzer` uses `replica.CostPerHour` when building `VariantCapacity.CostPerReplica` — taking the CostPerHour from any replica in the variant group (all replicas of the same variant have the same cost).

**Rationale**: The declared `ReplicaMetrics` type in the issue spec does not include `CostPerHour`. Adding this one field keeps the propagation chain clean without requiring the Analyzer to accept a cost map parameter (which would violate the `Analyze(ModelSignals) AnalyzerResult` interface contract). The Analyzer must remain pure: it must not access external state. The field is cheap to carry and semantically belongs on a replica snapshot.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Populate `VariantCapacity.CostPerReplica` in the orchestrator (cluster.go tick handler) after calling `Analyzer.Analyze()`: requires the orchestrator to re-look up cost per variant from NodePoolConfig. More indirection with no benefit. The Analyzer already groups by variant; doing the cost lookup in the Analyzer is simpler.
- Add a `CostMap map[VariantSpec]float64` parameter to `Analyze()`: changes the interface, violates the single-argument behavioral contract.

## Decision 4: HPAScrapeDelay uses existing DelaySpec

**Decision**: `DeploymentConfig.HPAScrapeDelay` is of type `DelaySpec` (existing, in `infra_config.go`), not a new `DistributionSpec` type.

**Rationale**: The design doc uses "DistributionSpec" as a conceptual name for a configurable delay distribution. The existing `DelaySpec{Mean, Stddev}` with Gaussian sampling already serves this purpose and is used for `NodePoolConfig.ProvisioningDelay` and `InstanceLifecycleConfig.LoadingDelay`. Introducing a new type would be duplicate code. `DelaySpec.IsZero()` directly implements the "zero = deterministic no-delay" semantic needed for INV-6 compatibility.

**Alternatives considered**:
- New `DistributionSpec` type with explicit `kind: constant/gaussian/uniform` enumeration: more expressive but unnecessary for current use cases. Deferred to a later PR if needed.

---

## Decision 5: Event priorities for autoscaler events

**Decision**: `ScalingTickEvent` priority = 8, `ScaleActuationEvent` priority = 9.

**Rationale**: Existing cluster events use priorities 0–7 (arrival=0 through PD events=4–7). Autoscaler events run after all request-path events at the same timestamp, which is correct: the scaler observes completed request state, not in-progress routing decisions. Both new event types are added to `cluster_event.go`.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Priority 10+: Unnecessarily large gap. 8 and 9 are the natural next values.
- Same priority as other events (interleaved): incorrect semantics — the scaler should see a stable snapshot.

---

## Decision 6: TTFT and DispatchRate are zero in DefaultCollector

**Decision**: `ReplicaMetrics.TTFT` and `ReplicaMetrics.DispatchRate` are populated as zero by `DefaultCollector` in this scope. `RoutingSnapshot` does not carry these signals.

**Rationale**: `TTFT` and `DispatchRate` are used only by the future `QueueingModelAnalyzer` (deferred). Neither `SaturationAnalyzer`, `UtilizationAnalyzer`, nor `QueueAnalyzer` reads these fields. Adding them to `RoutingSnapshot` requires metric collection infrastructure that does not yet exist. Zero values are safe defaults — `Analyzer.Analyze()` implementations must not divide by these fields without guarding.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Add TTFT tracking to `InstanceSimulator` and populate in `buildRouterState()`: premature; QueueingModelAnalyzer is out of scope for this feature.

---

## Decision 7: GPUInventory computation

**Decision**: A `gpuInventory()` helper on `ClusterSimulator` computes `GPUInventory.ByVariant` by iterating the instance list and counting: for each variant `v`, free slots = total GPU slots in all Ready nodes for variant `v` minus slots held by Running instances of variant `v` minus slots held by Loading instances of variant `v`. Pending placements are NOT subtracted. Draining instances ARE subtracted (they hold GPUs until drain completes).

**Rationale**: This matches the design doc's definition exactly. The `PlacementManager` already tracks node and instance state. The helper is a pure computation function over existing state — no new state needed.

## Decision 8: Stabilization window gate location

_Supersedes earlier cooldown design. Implemented in PR #1117 (issue #1108)._

**Decision**: Stabilization window state is tracked in two maps on `autoscalerPipeline`: `scaleUpFirstSignalAt map[string]int64` and `scaleDownFirstSignalAt map[string]int64` (keyed by ModelID). A `ScaleDecision` from the Engine is forwarded to the Actuator only once the signal has been continuously present for `ScaleUpStabilizationWindowUs` (or `ScaleDownStabilizationWindowUs`). If the signal disappears for any tick, the timer is reset. Window=0 passes on first signal.

**Rationale**: Stabilization window semantics match the Kubernetes HPA pre-event consistency gate — HPA waits until the recommendation has been stable for the window duration before acting, preventing premature action on transient load spikes. This replaced the original post-event cooldown (which locked out subsequent decisions for N µs after a decision fired) because cooldowns cannot suppress the first premature scale-up, only subsequent ones. Keeping gate state in `autoscalerPipeline` (not `ClusterSimulator`) keeps Engine and Analyzer stateless and independently testable.

## Decision 9: DrainPolicy for DirectActuator

**Decision**: `DirectActuator` uses the existing `InstanceState` transition `Active → Draining`. It does NOT call `PlacementManager.DrainNode()` (which is for node-level drain). Instead, it transitions the instance state to `Draining` directly and schedules a watch loop that frees GPUs when `InFlightCount == 0`. This implements WaitDrain semantics using existing instance lifecycle machinery.

**Rationale**: The full `DrainPolicy` interface (specs/010) is deferred. The existing `InstanceStateDraining` state already prevents the router from sending new requests (routable check skips Draining instances). Implementing WaitDrain as an instance-level state transition requires no new types.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Implement ImmediateDrain now (drop in-flight): not the right default; WaitDrain is safer and matches K8s graceful termination.
- Use `PlacementManager.DrainNode()`: that's for node-level drain (all instances on a node), not single-instance scale-down.
