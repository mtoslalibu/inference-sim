package sim

// ProgressHook receives periodic state snapshots during simulation execution.
// Implementations must treat snapshots as read-only and must not enqueue new
// simulation events or modify request state. A read-only, synchronous callback
// with no side-effects on simulation state cannot affect event ordering,
// therefore it cannot affect stdout (INV-6).
//
// This hook applies to both blis run and blis replay (both drive simulation
// through ClusterSimulator.Run). It does not apply to blis observe, which
// communicates with a real server.

// a freshly allocated slice (BC-7).
